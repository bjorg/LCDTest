Description
-----------
LCDTest is a small application to assist in common LCD adjustment tasks by providing test patterns.  These tasks include:
	1) Adjusting analog LCDs
	2) Detecting dead/lazy pixels
	3) Checking panel alignment
	4) Checking color transitions

These test patterns are designed to work for both monitors and projectors in single or multi-display configurations.  To test the desired display device, drag the 'LCDTest' window onto the display you wish to test.  Then click the 'Show Pattern' button.  All test patterns are terminated by pressing the Esc key.

Author's Notes
--------------
I wrote this application both as an exercise in Objective-C and as a port of a similar utility I had done earlier on the Windows platform.  I have found these patterns to invaluable on many occasions and hope they will prove just as useful to you.  If you have any suggestions for improvement, run into issues, or just want to say hi, don't hesitate to contact me.

Thanks to XIcons (www.xicons.com) for the free application icon.

Thanks to Daniel T. Griscom for his contributions on the gradient patterns.

Changes from 1.0
----------------
* Multiple gradient patterns
* Better presentation of the pattern instructions
* Hide cursor while showing pattern
* New application icon (cinema display)
* Added 'q' and 'Q' keys to exit pattern
